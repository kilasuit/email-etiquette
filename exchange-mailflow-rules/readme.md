## Background info

This folder and the items in it are due to some accidental mishaps that I had.
The first is already well documented as part of how I ended up leaving the Microsoft MVP Program.
I intended to get this done, but it slipped my mind. Until a similar but not as bad, a mishap occured recently.

Whoops indeed.

Anyway, with the code in this folder, as time goes on, you can add to your Exchange environment (Online or On-Premises) mailflow rules that will tenant wide block mishaps happening.

These can be used to ensure things like you don't get over spammed by people. Which is why Running a Exchange (or other Mail Server) is a useful and sensible way to manage and protect yourself. Especially if you want to have a very controlled list from which you accept mail from.
