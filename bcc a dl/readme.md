If you work in a big organisation, or like me, are on a number a of cross organisation distribution lists or listservs, then it's likely that you have some myriad of email rules that route all emails sent to a specific distribution list to a specific folder. This is a good email management practice as you can then filter your searches to a single folder that should just have conversations related to things sent to that distribution list. I know that this is how I've managed being on something like 40 very chatty distribution lists in recent years.

However the point of this post was due to a reoccurring theme that I am seeing in some of the distribution lists that I am on

That theme is as below

> Moving DL to BCC

I will say that this is the single most frustrating thing to see in an email that has landed directly in my inbox, because not only

- Should it have not landed in my inbox in the first place
- It's disconnected from the original thread in an organisational sense making searching less optimal.

So much so I have started to do this in return (highlighting the Moving DL to BCC in the senders email) & highlighting the "this" in the first line.

It's a really simple thing, but as someone that gets alerts on

- My Work Laptop's Desktop
- My Browser, if I am in SharePoint or anywhere else in Office 365
- My Phone
- My Fitbit

That's a lot of noise & distraction for something that was not critical for me to read, and in many cases, wasn't even that useful for me to read either.

I also add this line in every time this happens more than once a day (often from different senders)

> This is the second time I’ve had this happen this today.

I wonder if I'll ever get a day where I change the second time to tenth time, though I hope this post will stop that being the case

So Please, don't do that in future & feel free to make use of the draft above to send to others that you see do that in future too (& point them to this post too)
